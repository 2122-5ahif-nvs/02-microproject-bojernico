== Description
This project is designed to manage different recipes for different types of meals.
For these recipes, the CRUD methods are implemented and callable with JSON or and XML, whereas JSON gives the better results.

The import request imports 6 recipes into the database.

Furthermore, you can create a menu, which needs a starter, a main course and a dessert to deliver a successful result.

Worth mentioning is the calorie calculation of a single recipe.

You can also view the ingredients individually. For these, the CRUD methods have been implemented to simplify the management of recipes.
